        <p>Dear Solid Snake</p>
        <p>
            The nuclear weapons disposal facility on <span class="blurred">Shadow Moses Island</span>… 
            in Alaska's Fox Archipelago… was attacked and captured by Next-Generation Special Forces 
            being led by members of FOX-HOUND. They're demanding the remains of Big Boss, and if their 
            demands are not met within 24 hours, they'll launch a nuclear weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
            You'll have two mission objectives. First, rescue <span class="blurred">DARPA chief Donald 
            Anderson and ArmsTech president Kenneth Baker</span>--both hostages. Secondly, investigate 
            whether the terrorists have the ability to make a nuclear strike… and stop them if they do.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll approach the disposal facility by <span class="blurred">submarine</span>, then launch 
            a one-man SDV (swimmer delivery vehicle). From there, you'll have to swim.
