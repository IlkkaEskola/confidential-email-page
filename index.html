        <p>The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island… in Alaska's Fox Archipelago… <br>
            was attacked and captured by Next-Generation Special Forces being led by members of FOX-HOUND. <br>
            They're demanding the remains of Big Boss, and if their demands are not met within 24 hours, <br>
            they'll launch a nuclear weapon. You'll have two mission objectives. First, rescue DARPA chief <br>
            Donald Anderson and ArmsTech president Kenneth Baker—both hostages. Secondly, investigate whether <br>
            the terrorists have the ability to make a nuclear strike… and stop them if they do. We'll approach <br>
            the disposal facility by submarine, then launch a one-man SDV (swimmer delivery vehicle). From <br>
            there, you'll have to swim.
